"""Shared HTTP building blocks for talking to www.maccabipedia.co.il.

Two things every request to the wiki needs, and which this module centralises:

1. ``Accept: application/json`` — the host's Imunify360 WAF returns **HTTP 415
   "Unsupported Media Type"** to requests whose ``Accept`` header is the wildcard
   ``*/*`` (the default that ``requests`` and pywikibot send). The rule only fires
   for low-reputation / datacenter IPs, so it hit our scheduled CI jobs while the
   same URL succeeded from a residential connection. MediaWiki ignores ``Accept``
   (it picks the format from ``format=`` / CargoExport's ``&format=json``), so
   pinning a concrete value is purely to satisfy the WAF and never changes a body.
2. A retry ``Session`` across the wiki's transient edge blips (the openresty 415 /
   5xx window), so a single bad response doesn't fail a whole daily job.

pywikibot traffic is covered separately via ``extra_headers`` in
``pywikibot_configs/user-config.py``; this module is for the direct ``requests``
calls that bypass pywikibot.

# --- Diagnostics for the WAF block that outlived the Accept fix -----------------------
#
# Pinning `Accept: application/json` did stop the HTTP 415s (0 in 400 CI runs after the
# fix), but ~15% of scheduled runs still die on the FIRST call to the wiki with
# "API userinfo response lacks 'query' key" / "'str' object has no attribute 'items'" /
# "string indices must be integers". All three mean the same thing: the body parsed as
# JSON but came back as a *string* rather than the object MediaWiki owes us — i.e. an
# edge/WAF block page, not a wiki reply. We can't reproduce it locally (the Imunify360
# rule only fires for datacenter IPs), so instead of guessing we log the raw response the
# moment its shape is wrong. The next CI failure then carries the evidence to hand the host.
