# maccabistats Python Package — Knowledge Reference

The `maccabistats` package (v2.51, installed in the bot's venv) provides data loading, filtering, and statistical analysis for all Maccabi Tel-Aviv **football** game history. Source repo: `/mnt/c/code/maccabi_statistics/`.

---

## 1. Loading Data

```python
from maccabistats import (
    get_maccabi_stats,                    # Load from pickle file
    get_maccabi_stats_as_newest_wrapper,  # Load + wrap in latest MaccabiGamesStats
    load_from_maccabipedia_source,        # Load from cached MaccabiPedia crawl
    run_maccabipedia_source,              # Fresh crawl from wiki Cargo API (slow, minutes)
    load_from_maccabisite_source,         # Load from cached Maccabi TLV site crawl
    run_maccabitlv_site_source,           # Fresh crawl from maccabi-tlv.co.il
    serialize_maccabi_games,              # Pickle games to disk
)
```

- **Fastest**: `get_maccabi_stats("path.games")` — loads pre-serialized pickle from `~/maccabistats/`
- **Normal**: `load_from_maccabipedia_source()` — loads from already-crawled Cargo data
- **Fresh crawl**: `run_maccabipedia_source()` — hits wiki Cargo API, parses, applies fixes, serializes
- The bot typically uses `get_maccabi_stats_as_newest_wrapper()` or `load_from_maccabipedia_source()`

---

## 2. Fluent Filter API

All filters return a new `MaccabiGamesStats` object, enabling chaining:

```python
games.home_games.league_games.get_games_against_team("הפועל תל אביב").maccabi_wins
```

### Filter Properties (return `MaccabiGamesStats`)

| `maccabi_wins` / `maccabi_losses` / `maccabi_ties` | By result |
| `technical_result_games` | Technical result games |

### Filter Methods (return `MaccabiGamesStats`)
| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `get_games_against_team(name)` | vs specific opponent |
| `get_games_by_coach(name)` | under specific coach |
| `get_games_by_referee(name)` | with specific referee |
| `get_games_by_player_name(name)` | player in squad |

## 7. Cargo Integration

The package queries MaccabiPedia's MediaWiki Cargo extension:

- **Endpoint**: `http://www.maccabipedia.co.il/index.php?title=Special:CargoExport&format=json`
- **Pagination**: 5000 items per request via offset
- **Tables queried**:
  - `Football_Games` (joined with `Competitions`, `Stadiums`, `Opponents`) — game metadata
  - `Games_Events` — player events (goals, cards, subs, lineup) with fields: `_pageName, Date, PlayerName, PlayerNumber, Minute, EventType, SubType, Team, Part`
  - `Profiles` — player metadata (DoB, HomePlayer flag)
- **Crawler class**: `MaccabiPediaCargoChunksCrawler(tables_name, tables_fields, join_tables_on, where_condition)`

---

## 8. Bot Integration Patterns

### Event Translation Layer
`src/maccabipediabot/common/maccabistats_player_event.py` — `PlayerEvent` class translates maccabistats enums to Hebrew wiki labels:
```python
PlayerEvent.from_maccabistats_event_type(name, number, time_occur,
    GameEventTypes.GOAL_SCORE, GoalTypes.PENALTY, maccabi_player=True)
```

### Game Upload Flow
1. Load games via `get_maccabi_stats_as_newest_wrapper()` or `load_from_maccabipedia_source()`
2. Iterate `GameData` objects, extract metadata and player events
3. Translate events via `PlayerEvent` wrapper
4. Format into MediaWiki template arguments
5. Create/update wiki pages via pywikibot + mwparserfromhell

### Bot files using maccabistats
- `football/gamesbot.py` — main game page creation
- `football/upload_last_game_to_maccabipedia.py` — latest game upload
- `football/fetch_games_from_maccabi_tlv_site.py` — MaccabiTLV crawling
- `football/sort_players_events.py` — sort events in existing pages
- `football/bots/playersbot.py`, `coachesbot.py`, `teamsbot.py`, `refereesbot.py`, `stadiumsbot.py` — entity page creation
- `maintenance/football/refresh_games.py` — find games with missing events

---

## 9. Concrete Use Cases

### Questions maccabistats can answer
- Who are the all-time top scorers / assisters / most-capped players?
- What's the longest winning/unbeaten streak?
- Which season had the best win percentage?
- Who scored the most clutch goals (last 5 minutes, tying/winning)?
- What's our record against a specific opponent, home vs away?
- Who is the youngest/oldest player to score?
- Which coach has the best win record?
- Which players scored in their debut?
- What are the fastest 3 consecutive goals in a game?

- Which referee do we win most under?
- How many goals came from academy (home) players vs imports?

### Automation opportunities
- **Auto-generate stat pages**: season summaries, player career stats, head-to-head records
- **Data validation**: cross-reference wiki game pages against maccabistats data
- **Content enrichment**: add statistical context to player/team pages
- **Maintenance**: find games with missing events or inconsistent data
- **Reports**: periodic stat reports (e.g., after each season)
