# Local MaccabiPedia (Docker)

Runs a local MediaWiki 1.39.11 + PHP 7.4 + MariaDB mirror of the production
MaccabiPedia site. MediaWiki itself is built into the image. The default
MaccabiPedia skin is the `SkinMustache`-based skin vendored at
`<repo-root>/skins/Maccabipedia/` (its binary banner `assets/` are vendored
too). The prod third-party extensions are baked into the Docker image at build time
from `extensions.json` (SHA-pinned), so nothing is pulled from prod to render
the skin. Site-wide config lives in
`config/LocalSettings.shared.php` which ships byte-equivalent to prod.
Dev-only values (DB host, URL, fake secrets) are in
`config/LocalSettings.env.local.php` — prod has its own `.env.prod.php`.

## Prerequisites

- **Linux / WSL (Ubuntu/Debian):** run `bash scripts/setup-host.sh` once. It
  installs `docker.io` and `docker-compose-v2`, starts the docker daemon, and
  adds you to the `docker` group. Open a new shell (or `newgrp docker`) so
  `docker` works without sudo afterwards.
- **macOS / Windows:** install Docker Desktop manually (with WSL 2
  integration on Windows).

## First-time setup

```bash
cd infra/local-wiki
bash scripts/setup-host.sh            # docker + group membership

# Bring up a full, skin-rendering wiki. Extensions are baked into the image
# from extensions.json; the skin + its assets come from the repo. No prod fetch.
# (First build takes a few minutes — it downloads the pinned extensions.)
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open http://localhost:8080 — the `מכביפדיה` site renders with the MaccabiPedia
skin and prod's extension set, no sync required.

Admin user: `maccabi` / `maccabi2026` (from `docker-compose.yml`; local-only).

### Optional: seed sample content (no credentials)

The wiki renders the skin without this. Seed it only when you want real pages /
`MediaWiki:Common.{css,js}` locally. Pages are fetched over plain HTTP
(`Special:Export`) from the public site — no credentials needed.

```bash
uv run python scripts/download_pages_from_prod.py bootstrap   # site-scripts + sample pages
bash scripts/seed-content.sh                                   # import the downloaded XML dumps
```

## Adjusting the seed set

Pages pulled by `bootstrap` are listed in
`scripts/content-manifests/starter.manifest`. Edit that file (one page
title per line, `#` for comments), then:

```bash
uv run python scripts/download_pages_from_prod.py pages scripts/content-manifests/starter.manifest
bash scripts/seed-content.sh starter
```

Now browse e.g. `http://localhost:8080/index.php/ערן_זהבי`.

**Cargo note**: imports alone leave the Cargo tables empty — after importing
pages, import the table declarations and rebuild once (why Cargo's own
tooling can't: see the header of `scripts/populateLocalCargoData.php`).
The declaration list is built at runtime from prod, so tables added on prod
are picked up automatically:

```bash
uv run python scripts/download_pages_from_prod.py cargo-declarations
bash scripts/seed-content.sh cargo-declarations
bash scripts/recreate-cargo-tables.sh
```

The rebuild runs parallel workers (`CARGO_POPULATE_WORKERS`, default 8) and
finishes in ~2 minutes. Re-run after seeding more content with
`bash scripts/recreate-cargo-tables.sh --populate-only`.

When iterating, don't tear down with `-v`: a plain `docker compose down`
keeps the DB, so the next `up -d` skips the install and you only re-seed
what changed. Multiple manifests can be passed to one
`download_pages_from_prod.py pages` call — they download concurrently.

## Seeding a full season (any sport)

Derive every page a season needs (games, players, opponents, stadiums,
uniforms, premiere songs for football) straight from prod Cargo, then import:

```bash
uv run python scripts/generate_season_manifest.py football 2024/25
uv run python scripts/download_pages_from_prod.py pages scripts/content-manifests/season-football-2024-25.manifest
bash scripts/seed-content.sh season-football-2024-25
bash scripts/recreate-cargo-tables.sh
```

Sports: `football`, `basketball`, `volleyball`. Committed manifests cover
the most recent championship season of each (football 2024/25,
basketball 2023/24, volleyball 2024/25).

Cargo rows for the imported pages are regenerated locally from their
wikitext — no DB dump involved. Season-scoped queries (season page,
"games this season") are complete; career/all-time queries only see the
imported seasons.

After seeding content, pull in the category pages it references (squad
positions, game tracking categories, …) — derived from the local wiki's
wanted/linked categories, filtered to pages prod actually has:

```bash
uv run python scripts/generate_wanted_categories_manifest.py
uv run python scripts/download_pages_from_prod.py pages scripts/content-manifests/wanted-categories.manifest
bash scripts/seed-content.sh wanted-categories
```

Skin menu target pages are seeded with
`uv run python scripts/download_pages_from_prod.py menu-targets` — the list
is parsed at runtime from the skin source, so it follows menu changes
automatically. Images are not part of XML
dumps; the local stack resolves them from prod on demand via
`$wgForeignFileRepos` in `LocalSettings.env.local.php`. `<shtml>` blocks
(SecureHTML) are re-signed with the local dev key automatically during
`seed-content.sh` — prod's signatures can't validate here.

## Tear down

```bash
docker compose down          # keep data
docker compose down -v       # wipe DB + images + install marker
```

## Files

- `Dockerfile` — `FROM php:7.4.33-apache-bullseye`, installs MW 1.39.11 +
  PHP extensions (intl, gd, mysqli, zip, mbstring, calendar, opcache, apcu
  pinned to 5.1.24), then downloads the SHA-pinned third-party extensions from
  `extensions.json` into the image (`fetch-extensions.sh`). All versions
  pinned for reproducibility.
- `extensions.json` — SHA-pinned manifest of the third-party extensions
  `LocalSettings.shared.php` loads that aren't bundled in MW 1.39 core
  (each entry: `name`, `repo`, `ref`, `commit`, optional `note`). Baked into
  the image at build time; never synced from prod, never committed as code.
- `scripts/fetch-extensions.sh` — build-time downloader (bash: runs inside the
  image, which has curl+jq but no Python). Downloads each manifest entry's
  pinned `commit` as an HTTPS tarball (GitHub `…/archive/<sha>.tar.gz` or gerrit
  gitiles `…/+archive/<sha>.tar.gz`) and extracts it — no git in the image.
- `scripts/resolve_extension_pins.py` — host-side re-pin/bump tool: edit an
  entry's `ref` (branch/tag/SHA), run `uv run python scripts/resolve_extension_pins.py`,
  and the `commit` is refreshed via `git ls-remote` (uses the dev host's git;
  the image itself has none).
- `docker-compose.yml` — `mediawiki` (built locally) + `mariadb:10.11`.
  Named volumes: `mw_db`, `mw_images`, `mw_config` (first-boot marker).
  Mediawiki healthcheck polls `http://localhost/`.
- `entrypoint.sh` — on first boot runs `install.php` with prefix `MPMW_`
  (output discarded to `/tmp`, state tracked via `/generated/.installed`);
  every boot copies the stub to `/var/www/html/LocalSettings.php` as a
  real file and symlinks env+shared as siblings, `php -l` checks the
  result, then runs `update.php --quick`.
- `config/` — the three split `LocalSettings*.php` files. Mounted
  read-only into the container at `/mw-config/`.
  - `LocalSettings.stub.php` — 5-line bootstrap: `require_once` env then
    shared.
  - `LocalSettings.env.local.php` — dev env values (`mariadb` host, dev
    creds from `MW_DB_*` env, verbose errors, `CACHE_NONE`, fake keys).
  - `LocalSettings.shared.php` — site-wide config (extensions, skins,
    namespaces, hooks, Cargo, ContactPage, TabberNeue, …). Byte-equivalent
    to prod's `LocalSettings.shared.php`; prod uploads this file manually
    when it changes.
  `config/` also holds the **webroot static files** mounted individually into
  the container root: `htaccess` → `/var/www/html/.htaccess` and `favicon.ico`
  → `/var/www/html/favicon.ico` (a site-wide asset `$wgFavicon` points at — not
  a skin asset), plus `apache-allow-override.conf` for Apache.
- `scripts/setup-host.sh` — one-shot host-prereq installer (docker,
  compose). Idempotent.
- `scripts/download_pages_from_prod.py` — downloads wiki PAGES from the public
  prod site over HTTP (`requests` + `Special:Export`) into `downloaded-pages/`.
  Host-side (`uv run python …`), read-only, no credentials. Ops: `bootstrap`,
  `site-scripts`, `pages <manifest>`. Optional — not needed to render the skin
  (extensions are
  baked into the image; the skin's assets are vendored under
  `skins/Maccabipedia/assets/`; the favicon is a vendored webroot file at
  `config/favicon.ico`). Use it only to seed real content. The skin source is
  vendored at `<repo-root>/skins/Maccabipedia/` and is NOT touched by this script.
  `site-scripts` pulls `MediaWiki:Common.css` + `MediaWiki:Common.js` (the
  site-wide CSS/JS that back the `site.styles` bundle, CanvasJS hooks, and
  the fanzine form); kept separate from `starter.manifest` because they're
  site-wide assets, not sample content.
- `scripts/seed-content.sh` — imports pulled XML dumps into the running
  container via `importDump.php`, then `rebuildall.php` + `runJobs.php`.
- `scripts/content-manifests/starter.manifest` — editable list of page titles
  to pull.

## Follow-ups (not yet shipped)

- Prod DB dump importer for full Cargo-table parity. Requires a `.sql`
  export from the hosting panel's phpMyAdmin.
- Bot-target integration: a `[maccabipedia-local]` profile in
  `pywikibot_configs/user-password.py` + `MACCABIPEDIA_SITE=local` env
  switch so the Python bots target the local wiki.
