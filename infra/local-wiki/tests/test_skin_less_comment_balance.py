"""Static guard: every skin LESS file has balanced ``/* */`` block comments.

A dropped ``*`` turns a comment close ``*/`` into a bare ``/``, leaving the
comment open until the *next* ``*/`` — which silently swallows every rule in
between. This bit a skin once when an automated edit changed
``/* --- Top 10 Players Tables --- */`` to ``... --- /``: prod's ``less.php``
dropped the whole file, taking the ``.slim-tabs`` tab-switching engine with it
(tabs rendered but stopped switching), while node ``less.js`` in CI/dev tolerated
it and never flagged the breakage.

A plain "is every ``/*`` eventually closed" scan does NOT catch this — the next
comment's ``*/`` closes the runaway — so we assert the raw per-file counts of
``/*`` and ``*/`` are equal. Reads files from disk; needs no live wiki.
